Notes to myself
	- The open/close hours should be embedded somewhere else than in the
	  calendar; There is two much entry to retreive otherwise.
	- Let's first focus on the data retrieval aspect. No UI at this point.
	  The UI should be decoupled from the data set such that if we eventually
	  decide to ditch gcal then it's going to be easy.
	  We just need a data model to present the availability / open / close / coupon hours...
